# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is a basic practice project I created to improve my web development skills. This project was developed with guidance and support from Shraddha Didi of Apna College.

## Features
- **2-player gameplay**: You can play the game with a friend by taking turns placing X's and O's on the board.
- **Interactive UI**: The game interface is interactive and intuitive, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive design**: The game works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Win condition**: The game checks for the winner once the board is filled or the game is a draw.
